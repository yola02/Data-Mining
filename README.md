Data Mining — Applied Analysis & Project Work

This repository contains homework assignments and a data mining project completed as part of a Data Mining course. The work focuses on extracting patterns, trends, and insights from real-world datasets using analytical and machine learning techniques.

The main project uses a subset of the MovieLens dataset, exploring user–item interactions to understand preferences and support predictive modeling and recommendation tasks.

What’s Covered:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature selection and transformation

Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques

Pattern discovery and evaluation

Project Focus:

Analyzed user–item rating data to identify behavioral patterns and trends

Applied data mining techniques to support rating prediction and recommendation scenarios

Evaluated models using appropriate metrics and compared results across approaches

Tools & Technologies:

Python | Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn | Jupyter Notebooks

Key Takeaways:

Developed a structured approach to exploring large datasets and identifying meaningful signals

Learned to balance model complexity, interpretability, and performance

Strengthened ability to translate analytical findings into clear insights

Notes:

This repository emphasizes analytical thinking and applied data mining methods rather than production deployment. The project demonstrates how data mining techniques can be used to understand user behavior and inform product-level decisions.
